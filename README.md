**CONNECTIVE** is a library to enable _Agent_ (or _Actor_) based [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) in Type(Java)Script. Under the hood, it is a thin layer on top of [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), offering an interface for composing observable streams using higher level concepts such as _Agents_ and _Nodes_.
