**CONNECTIVE** is a library for _Agent_ (or _Actor_) based [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) in Type(Java)Script. It is a thin layer on top of [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), enabling further modularization of data/event stream management by decoupling description of the data flow and actual creation of streams (i.e. `Observer`s), and introducing _Agent_ based concepts for organizing various parts of a data/event flow.
