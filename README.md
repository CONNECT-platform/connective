# CONNECTIVE

**CONNECTIVE** aims to facilitate large-scale [_Reactive_](http://reactivex.io) projects, i.e. projects based on asynchronous interactions between streams of data. It is a library on top of [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), facilitating creation and composition of complex graph flows of observables and data/event streams. It introduces flow design and agent-based programming concepts (like `Agent`s) to avail a much more intuitive interface for proper reactive programming that can scale.
