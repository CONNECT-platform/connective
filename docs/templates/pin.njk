<h1 id="">Pin</h1>

<span code>pin()</span> is a relay for incoming events/data:
<img src="/docs/assets/animations/pin.svg" class="animation"/>

<i>Pin</i> is the parent class of most of more elaborate types of pins in <b>CONNECTIVE</b>. It is the most
fundamental element of a reactive flow. Different pin types
exhibit different behaviors, for example <span code>control()</span> waits for all incoming connections
before each emission, <span code>pack()</span> waits for all incoming connections before the first emission
and will combine the latest emission from each from that point on, <span code>filter()</span> will only let
specific emissions through, etc.

<h2 id="connecting">Connecting Pins</h2>

You can connect pins together using their <span code>.from()</span> and <span code>.to()</span> methods:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { pin } from '@connectv/core';

let a = pin();
let b = pin();
let c = pin();

a.to(b);   //--&gt; anything that comes through a will be passed to b
c.from(a); //--&gt; anything that comes through a will be passed to c as well</code>
</pre>

You can also pass multiple arguments to <span code>.to()</span> and <span code>.from()</span> methods:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { pin } from '@connectv/core';

let a = pin();
let b = pin();
let c = pin();

a.to(b, c); //--&gt; anything going through a will be passed to b and c</code>
</pre>

<span code>.to()</span> and <span code>.from()</span> return the pin passed to them, so that you can easily chain them:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { pin } from '@connectv/core';

let a = pin();
let b = pin();
let c = pin();

console.log(a.to(b) == b); //&gt; true

a.to(b).to(c);  //--&gt; a is connected to b, b is connected to c.</code>
</pre>

When you pass multiple pins to <span code>.to()</span> or <span code>.from()</span> methods, the return
value is a <i>group</i> of pins, containing the pins you passed to the method:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { pin } from '@connectv/core';

let a = pin();
let b = pin();
let c = pin();
let d = pin();

a.to(b, c).to(d);  //--&gt; a is connected to b and c, b and c are connected to d.</code>
</pre>

You can start a sequence of connections with such a group, using <span code>group()</span>:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { pin, group } from '@connectv/core';

let a = pin();
let b = pin();
let c = pin();

group(b, c).from(a); //--&gt; a is connected to b and c.</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
Mostly you would use some other pin type in your reactive flows. However, you could use
the basic relay function of <span code>pin()</span> to <i>OR</i> multiple control signals:

<pre>
<code class="javascript">import { source, pin, gate, group } from '@connectv/core';

let a = source();
let b = source();
let c = source();

let g1 = gate();
let g2 = gate();

group(a, b).to(g1.control);           //--&gt; g1 will let data through when a AND b emit
group(a, b).to(pin()).to(g2.control); //--&gt; g2 will let data through when a OR b emit

c.to(g1.input, g2.input);
g1.output.subscribe(v =&gt; console.log('G1:: ' + v));
g2.output.subscribe(v =&gt; console.log('G2:: ' + v));

c.send(1); a.send(true); b.send(true);
c.send(2); a.send(true);</code>
</pre>
