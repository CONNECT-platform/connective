<h1 id="">Agent</h1>

<span code>Agent</span> class in <b>CONNECTIVE</b> is the base abstraction of a reactive flow. Regardless of how it works
internally, any agent (or any reactive flow) can be thought of as something that can respond to some events/data
(sources, input pins, etc) and its response is typically emitting some other events/data (its sinks, output pins, etc).

<br><br>

Agents are to be used to modularize your reactive flows. For example, any repeating sub-graph of a reactive flow is,
by definition outlined above, an agent, and so you could replace it with an agent instead of repeating yourself constantly, the
same way that you would encapsulate repeated logic in a function and/or a class:

<pre>
  <code class="javascript">import { Agent, sink, map, block } from '@connectv/core';

export class Multi extends Agent {
  private k = 1;

  constructor() {
    super({
      inputs: ['n', 'k'], //--&gt; we have two inputs: 'n', and 'k'
      outputs: ['o']      //--&gt; and one output: 'o'
    });

    //
    //--&gt; get every value from input 'n', multiply it by 'k',
    //--&gt; and pass it to the output.
    //
    this.in('n').to(map(n =&gt; n * this.k)).to(this.out('o'));

    //
    //--&gt; `block()` is used here to make the output dependent on
    //--&gt; the input 'k', without the input directly passing any value
    //--&gt; to the output. basically this just ensures that when the output
    //--&gt; is bound, so is the input 'k'.
    //
    this.in('k').to(sink(k =&gt; this.k = k)).to(block()).to(this.out('o'));
  }
}</code>
</pre>
<div class="buttons">
  <a class="button" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/connective-agent-ex1?file=multi.ts" target="_blank">TRY IT!</a>
</div>

Our custom agent here has two inputs: <span code>'n'</span> and <span code>'k'</span>, and one output, <span code>'o'</span>.
It will multiply anything that comes through <span code>'n'</span> by <span code>this.k</span> (default 1) and send it
to <span code>'o'</span>, and values sent to <span code>'k'</span> will update <span code>this.k</span>.

<br><br>

Now that we have our custom agent defined, we can use it in our other reactive flows like this:

<pre>
  <code class="javascript">import { wrap, map } from '@connectv/core';
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { Multi } from './multi';

let n = document.getElementById('n') as HTMLInputElement;
let k = document.getElementById('k') as HTMLInputElement;
let p = document.getElementById('p');
let m = new Multi();

wrap(fromEvent(n, 'input')).to(map(() =&gt; n.value)).to(m.in('n'));
wrap(fromEvent(k, 'input')).to(map(() =&gt; k.value)).to(m.in('k'));
m.out('o').subscribe(v =&gt; p.innerHTML = v);</code>
</pre>
<div class="buttons">
  <a class="button" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/connective-agent-ex1?file=index.ts" target="_blank">TRY IT!</a>
</div>

<b>NOTICE</b>: This is just an example of how you could define custom agents and it is <b>NOT</b> the recommended method.
The recommended way of creating your custom agents is using the <a href="/docs/composition"><span code>Composition</span></a>
class, as it also takes care of a lot of boilerplate stuff related to custom agents such as memory management.

<br><br>

<h2 id="signature">Signature</h2>

Each agent has a signature, which is an object indicating the name of the input and output pins of the agent.
In the case of our example custom agent, this bit of code outlines the signature:

<pre>
  <code class="javascript">  constructor() {
    super({
      inputs: ['n', 'k'], //--&gt; we have two inputs: 'n', and 'k'
      outputs: ['o']      //--&gt; and one output: 'o'
    });

    ...</code>
</pre>

The signature object needs to be passed to <span code>Agent</span> constructor. It has two arrays of
strings:
<ul>
  <li><span code>inputs</span> denotes name of all input pins of the agent. It is optional.</li>
  <li><span code>outputs</span> denotes name of all output pins of the agent. It is required.</li>
</ul>

So in case of our example, any instance of <span code>Multi</span> will have two inputs, <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>,
and one output, <i>o</i>. You can access these pins (both from within the agent and from outside) using
<span code>.in()</span> and <span code>.out()</span> methods:

<pre>
  <code class="javascript">// within the agent ...
this.in('k');
this.out('o');

// from outside ...
let m = new Multi();
m.in('n');
m.out('o');</code>
</pre>

You can also access the signature object of each agent via its <span code>.signature</span> property.

<br><br>

<h3 id="control">Control</h3>

An agent might have an extra <a href="/docs/control">control pin</a> accessible via its <span code>.control</span>
property. This pin is typically used to control the behavior of the agent, like prevent it from responding except
when certain criteria is met, or signal it to reset its internal state.

<br><br>

Note that <span code>.control</span> is not mentioned in an agent's signature.

<br><br>

<h2 id="clear">Clearing up</h2>

All agents are equipped with a <span code>.clear()</span> method that will clear out the internal machinery of the agent.
It will clear up all internal subscriptions, pins, agents, etc. Similar to <a href="/docs/pin#clear">pin's
<span code>.clear()</span></a>, this method will render the agent useless, so use it only when you are done with the agent.

<br><br>

For your custom agents, you must also be careful to properly implement <span code>.clear()</span>. It is highly recommended
to use the <a href="/docs/composition"><span code>Composition</span></a> class as it will manage this (along other stuff)
for you.
