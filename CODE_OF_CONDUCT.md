# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We, as maintainers and contributors, pledge to ensure that everyone interested in
contributing to this project feels encouraged and welcome to do so. This means ensuring that no one
feels discouraged or barred from contributing to this project, regardless of their background,
gender, ethnicity, belief, political alignment, age, keyword-per-minute record, shoe-size, 
their interest level in the project, etc,
and regardless of the type and extent of their contribution, whether it is a passing and vague comment without
any further elaboration or whether it is an extensive pull-request changing half of the code-base.

## Our Standards

Following are guidelines that help maintain and grow a welcoming and effective community:

- Reflect opinions on codes and words, not the person behind those codes/words.
- Be tolerant of criticism. Do not take it personally, unless it is already breaking the first guideline.
- Remain focused on progressing the discussion. Change your tone/perspective the moment you realise its not helping.
- Genuinely be open to and embrace being proven wrong.

The following are note-worthy examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Any form of harassment towards any other participant, either public or private
- Intentional use of language/imagery/etc counter-productive to the progress of the discussion
- Any form of trolling, or any other destructive form of communication
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the guidelines for acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate action in response to any instances 
of unacceptable behavior, or any behavior that might steer the community away
from being a welcoming one for everyone.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing this project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at ghanizadeh.eugene@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
